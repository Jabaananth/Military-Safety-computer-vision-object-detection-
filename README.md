Project Summary: Military Object Detection using Computer Vision & Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a real-time military object detection system using advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The system is designed to enhance soldier safety, situational awareness, and defense monitoring by automatically identifying and classifying military-related objects such as weapons, vehicles, protective gear, and soldiers in video feeds or images.

We employed the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for fast and accurate object detection. The model was trained on a curated military dataset consisting of annotated images of different weapon types, soldiers, and battlefield equipment. To process the data, we used Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface.

The project workflow included:

Data Collection & Preprocessing – Gathering and annotating military datasets, resizing, and augmenting images.

Model Training – Training YOLO-based models with GPU acceleration for high accuracy and low latency.

Evaluation – Measuring precision, recall, mAP (mean Average Precision), and FPS (frames per second) performance.

Deployment – Building a lightweight application using Streamlit, enabling real-time video surveillance and detection.

Key Outcomes:

Achieved accurate detection of weapons and military objects in varied environments.

Real-time processing capability suitable for surveillance drones, defense systems, and border security monitoring.

Flexible deployment for field use, supporting both live camera input and pre-recorded footage.

Applications:

Soldier safety monitoring.

Automated weapon detection in restricted zones.

Military surveillance and reconnaissance.

Border security and counter-terrorism operations.
